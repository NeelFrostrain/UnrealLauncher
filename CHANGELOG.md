### ✅ Added

- 🧹 **Code Quality Improvements** — Fixed all ESLint warnings and TypeScript diagnostics for clean builds
- 📚 **Build Process Documentation** — Comprehensive BUILD.md guide for developers with step-by-step instructions

### 🛠️ Fixed

- 🎨 **Border Radius Not Syncing** — Card components were using hardcoded Tailwind classes instead of theme border radius
- 🔧 **Missing Native Module Compilation** — Build process now properly compiles and includes native Rust modules

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-05

### ✅ Added

- 🗂️ **List & Grid View** — Projects page now supports two view modes. Toggle between a flat list and a thumbnail grid. Selected mode is saved and restored on next launch.
- 📦 **Batch Project Import** — Selecting a folder with many projects now imports up to 20 at a time instead of freezing the app. A warning toast tells you how many were skipped so you can re-add the folder to continue.
- 🎨 **Redesigned Project Cards** — List view shows a flat row with thumbnail, name, version badge, date, size, and a 3-dot dropdown menu. Grid view shows a thumbnail card with hover overlay and action buttons sliding up from the bottom.
- ⋮ **3-dot Dropdown Menu** — Project card actions (Favorites, Open Folder, Remove) are now in a dropdown rendered via a React portal so it never gets clipped by scroll containers.
- 💡 **Neon Border on Hover** — Grid cards show a blue neon glow on hover.
- 🔔 **Redesigned Toast Notifications** — Custom stacking toasts with colored left accent bar, auto-dismiss after 4s, and an X button to close. Max 5 visible at once.
- 💾 **Persist Last Open Page** — The app remembers which page you were on and reopens it on next launch.
- 💾 **Persist View Mode** — List/grid preference is saved to localStorage and restored on launch.
- 🛡️ **Error Boundary** — A React error boundary wraps the app so a page crash shows a recoverable error screen instead of a blank window.
- 🔐 **openExternal URL Validation** — The `open-external` IPC handler now only allows `https:` URLs.
- ⚡ **Settings Cache** — `getSetting` no longer re-parses localStorage on every call — result is cached in memory.
- 🧹 **Code Cleanup** — Removed unused `lucide-react` dependency, fixed duplicate `dialog` import, renamed `usePagesStore.tsx` to `.ts`, consolidated duplicate type definitions.

### 🛠️ Fixed

- 🐛 Favorites tab showing nothing — fixed stale closure in `filterForTab` by passing favorites as a parameter instead of capturing from state.
- 🐛 Dropdown menus clipped by scroll container — now rendered via `ReactDOM.createPortal` into `document.body`.
- 🐛 Toast X button not working — fixed by adding `pointer-events-auto select-auto` to the toast container to override the app-level `select-none`.
- 🐛 `sandbox: true` breaking IPC — reverted to `sandbox: false` since the preload uses Node.js APIs.
- 🐛 Relative import paths broken after component folder reorganization — fixed `../types`, `../utils` paths to `../../types`, `../../utils` in moved components.
- 🐛 `ProjectsPage` scanning on every tab switch — now scans once on mount/refresh and filters client-side per tab using a ref.
- 🐛 `favoritePaths` breaking `useMemo` — moved to React state so the dependency reference is stable.

### 🏗️ Changed

- 📁 **Component folder reorganization** — components split into `layout/`, `engines/`, `projects/`, `ui/`, `about/` subfolders.
- 🔀 Main process split into `index.ts`, `window.ts`, `updater.ts`, `ipcHandlers.ts`, `store.ts`, `utils.ts`, `types.ts`.
- 📦 Moved all Vite-bundled packages (MUI, framer-motion, zustand, etc.) to `devDependencies` to speed up electron-builder packaging.
