## [2.1.1] - 2026-04-20 — `v2.1.1`

### 🛠️ Fixed

- **Linux engine launch blocked by KIO** — Engine executables are now spawned directly instead of via `xdg-open`. `xdg-open` is only used for non-executable files (directories, `.uproject` files). All spawned processes call `.unref()` so the launcher doesn't hold child processes alive
- **Engine detection ignores folder name** — Scanner no longer requires folders to be named `UE_*`. Any directory containing `Engine/Build/Build.version` is now recognised as a valid engine installation regardless of name (fixes source builds named `UnrealEngine`, `MyEngine`, etc.)
- **Engine version read from `Build.version`** — Version is always resolved from `Engine/Build/Build.version` (`MajorVersion.MinorVersion`) instead of being stripped from the folder name
- **Engine root vs parent path ambiguity** — Scan paths are now handled with dual-mode logic: if the path itself is an engine root it is used directly; otherwise its subdirectories are scanned. Fixes the case where a user adds `/home/user/UnrealEngine` directly as a scan path
- **Linux engine scan paths stored as dedicated JSON** — `engine-scan-paths.json` in the save folder, consistent with `engines.json` and `projects.json`, instead of being embedded in `settings.json`
- **Linux project scan paths stored as dedicated JSON** — `project-scan-paths.json` in the save folder, same pattern as engine scan paths
- **Settings page engine scan section Linux-only** — The engine scan folder UI and `UE_ROOT` env var hint are now only shown on Linux
- **`UE_ROOT` environment variable support (Linux only)** — Set `UE_ROOT` to a directory containing engine builds; picked up automatically on every scan without needing the settings UI
- **Native module loading in packaged builds** — `native/dist/index.js` now resolves `.node` files from `app.asar.unpacked` when running inside an asar archive, preventing load failures in AppImage and deb builds. Falls back gracefully to `null` instead of throwing
- **`asarUnpack` covers entire `native/dist/`** — All native module files (`.node`, `.js`, `.d.ts`) are unpacked from the asar so they can be loaded at runtime
- **Linux build script missing `electron-builder` call** — `build:linux` now runs `electron-builder --linux --publish=never` after the vite build, actually producing AppImage and deb artifacts. Added `build:linux:unpack` for fast unpacked-only builds
- **`electron-builder.yml` schema errors** — Removed invalid `desktop.Name/Comment/Categories` block (not supported in electron-builder v26), removed non-existent `dmg.background` reference, removed invalid `artifactBuildStarted: null` field, fixed `linux.target` to use proper object form with `arch`, changed `compression` from `maximum` to `normal`
- **`asar: false` + `asarUnpack` contradiction** — Changed to `asar: true` with `asarUnpack` so native modules are correctly extracted
- **Rust `validate_engine_folder` hardcoded to `Win64`** — Now uses `#[cfg]` platform conditionals to check the correct binary directory on Linux (`Engine/Binaries/Linux`) and macOS (`Engine/Binaries/Mac`)
- **Glob patterns in Linux scan paths** — Removed paths like `/usr/local/UnrealEngine*` that `fs.existsSync` cannot expand; replaced with explicit directory scanning of common parent paths
- **Duplicate `const os` / `const platform` in engine scan worker** — Fixed variable redeclaration that caused a runtime error in the JS fallback scan path
- **Projects page load order** — Saved projects are now shown immediately on page open; background scan runs after and only appends newly discovered projects to `projects.json` without overwriting existing entries
- **Unused imports removed** — `exec` from `child_process` in `projects.ts`, `os` in `fabScanner.ts` and `scanWorker.ts`
- **Missing `fs` import in `platformPaths.ts`** — Caused TypeScript errors when the Linux parent-directory scan code ran

### ✅ Added

- **Engine scan folder settings (Linux)** — New "Engines" section in Settings (Linux only) to add custom parent directories for engine scanning, with add/remove UI matching the Projects scan folder section
- **`UE_ROOT` env var hint in settings** — Informational row explaining the `UE_ROOT` alternative to the UI-configured paths

## [2.0.4] - 2026-04-13 — `v2.0.4`

### 🛠️ Fixed

- Enhanced project deduplication logic to handle path variations (case sensitivity, backslash/forward slash differences) by normalizing project paths before comparison.
- Added `normalizeProjectPath` function in `src/main/store.ts` and `src/main/scanWorker.ts` to convert paths to lowercase and standardize separators.
- Used a Map with normalized keys in `scanWorker.ts` for deduping scanned projects and ensured consistent normalized comparisons during merge operations.
- Added renderer-side deduplication in `src/renderer/src/pages/ProjectsPage.tsx` with `dedupeProjectList` function to prevent duplicate cards when switching between tabs (All, Favorites, Recent) or refreshing the project list.
